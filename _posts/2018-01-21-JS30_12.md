title: JS30 Challenge Day12 - Key Sequence Detection (KONAMI CODE)
---

Today was an easy one but it was great for remind me some things like:

pressed.splice(-secretCode.length - 1, pressed.length - secretCode.length);
It allows to take the ending part of an array.

if(touches.join('').includes(secretCode))
The includes() part.
